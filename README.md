### Performance Evaluation of the Two Color Detection Algorithms

**Introduction**

In this project perform a performance evaluation of the two image color detection models. These machine learning models automatically turn grayscale images into colored images. 

The first model is called Image Colorization Basic Implementation with CNN and was built by Victor Basu(https://www.kaggle.com/code/basu369victor/image-colorization-basic-implementati on-with-cnn/notebook).

The second model is called Colorizing B&W Photos with Neural Networks and was built by Emill Warner(https://blog.floydhub.com/colorizing-b-w-photos-with-neural-networks/).
